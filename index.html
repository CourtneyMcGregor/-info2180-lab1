 <h2>Courtney McGregor</h2>
 <p>My name is Courtney McGregor, I am 20 years old. I graduated the St. Jago High School with 9 CSEC and 8 CAPE subjects.
    <br> I am currently persuing a double major in Accounting and Computer Science with cumulative GPA of 3.84.
    <br> They say great men do great things because they think they are great and fools because they they think they are easy... who knows, maybe im both
    <br>
    <br>I'm drawn to web development due to its blend of creativity and problem-solving.
    <br>It lets me turn ideas into interactive global experiences, and the ever-changing tech landscape keeps me engaged.
    <br>Coding, bringing text to life as functional websites, is my passion, and I love enhancing user experiences.
    <br>Web development aligns with my artistic and digital interests, making it a dynamic and fulfilling field to pursue.
